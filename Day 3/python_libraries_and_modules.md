# What are Libraries and modules?

**Module** = A single file of *functions, classes, variables etc.* that you can bring in and use in another Python file.

**Library** = A collection of *modules*. Needs to be **installed with pip**.

In essence, the difference between the two is that a module is *a set of code or functions* with the **.py extension**, whereas a library is *a collection* of related modules or packages. 

They can be very useful as it can save you a lot of time and provide a lot of quick resources.

### Built-in Modules
Python has a **huge** number of built-in modules. Some of the most important ones are:
- **math**: You can use this to perform various mathematical calculations, such as numeric, trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential calculations. 
- **datetime**: This supplies classes to work with **date and time**. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times, and time intervals. Date and DateTime are an object in Python, so when you manipulate them, you are *actually manipulating objects* and not strings or timestamps.
- **statistics**: This provides functions for *calculating mathematical statistics of numeric (Real-valued) data*. It is aimed at the **level of graphing and scientific calculators.**
- **random**: This is used to generate random numbers in Python. These are pseudo-random numbers, which means they are not **truly random**. This module can be used to perform random actions such as *generating random numbers, printing random a value for a list or string etc.*
- **os**: This has methods for interacting with **the operating system**, like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input, output, environment variables, process management etc.
- **sys**: This provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate **different parts of the Python runtime environment**. It allows *operating on the interpreter* as it provides access to the variables and functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
